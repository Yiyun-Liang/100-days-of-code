# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 0: December 31, 2016 Saturday

### Day 1: January 3, 2017 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a simple project using React.js and learnt the basics of React components and JSX.

**Thoughts**: I've recently started using React for web development, and I have a great feeling about it.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on two simple static website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. One website uses apis to generate random quotes for the user, the other one uses twitch.tv api to forward channels.

**Thoughts**: Adding javascript and animation really makes the website more interesting. For api integrations, mostly used getJSON and ajax calls.

### Day 3: January 5, 2017 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Started working on a web app that prompts user for input and looks like a terminal. This is inspired by Alexander Kallaway's project.

**Thoughts**: Some planning and brainstorming is very helpful for development.

### Day 4: January 6, 2017 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on terminal-interface.

**Thoughts**: Need to work on CSS.

### Day 5: January 7, 2017 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on terminal-interface. Handled the detection of different key press.

**Thoughts**: [http://keycode.info/](http://keycode.info/) helps me find key codes.

### Day 6: January 8, 2017 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Included the use of webpack in the React project and made the project more scalable by having multiple jsx components files.

**Thoughts**: Since we might be using the same components multiple times in the future, it would be more scalable if we put components into separate files.

### Day 7: January 9, 2017 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started another project using React. This project uses a weather api and React router.

**Thoughts**: Webpack provides a lot of good features such as alias.

### Day 8: January 10, 2017 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Recently learnt a multimedia framework with a plugin based architecture named GStreamer, and used it to built an audio player. 

**Thoughts**: GStreamer is very extensible because it is plugin-based and components are pipeline, so we can write custom plugins to suit our apps. How GStreamer and ffmpeg differs and helps video and audio streaming can be investigated furthur.

### Day 9: January 11, 2017 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on React Weather. 

**Thoughts**: Promises are resolved or rejected. It can be used to replace asynchronous calls that accept callbacks.

### Day 10: January 12, 2017 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on React Weather. Started implementing API calls in the app.

**Thoughts**: ES6 syntax such as query strings helps concatenate strings to form URLs with parameters, and the axios node package helps make http requests from node.js with promises.

### Day 11: January 13, 2017 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on React Weather. Spent some time on debugging... and learnt about ES6 arrow functions.

**Thoughts**: It is very easy for React projects to break so in order to debug the app, an useful browser extension is 1. 'React developer tools' by Facebook. Another useful thing to do is to add breakpoints into code using 2. 'debugger;'. One more thing we can do is to add 3. source maps like 'devtool:"cheap-module-eval-source-map"' inside webpack.config.js.

### Day 12: January 14, 2017 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on React Weather. Started styling the pages using foundation css framework(nav bar, main page position, modals, etc) and jquery.

**Thoughts**: Keep going! Fighting!
