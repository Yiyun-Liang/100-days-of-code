### Day 2: January 4, 2017 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on two simple static website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. One website uses apis to generate random quotes for the user, the other one uses twitch.tv api to forward channels.

**Thoughts**: Adding javascript and animation really makes the website more interesting. For api integrations, mostly used getJSON and ajax calls.
