### Day 3: January 5, 2017 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Started working on a web app that prompts user for input and looks like a terminal. This is inspired by Alexander Kallaway's project.

**Thoughts**: Some planning and brainstorming is very helpful for development.

**Link(s) to work**: [Terminal Web App](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/terminal-interface)



### Day 4: January 6, 2017 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on terminal-interface.

**Thoughts**: Need to work on CSS.

**Link(s) to work**: [Terminal Web App](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/terminal-interface)



### Day 5: January 7, 2017 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on terminal-interface. Handled the detection of different key press.

**Thoughts**: [http://keycode.info/](http://keycode.info/) helps me find key codes.

**Link(s) to work**: [Terminal Web App](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/terminal-interface)



### Day 6: January 8, 2017 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Included the use of webpack in the React project and made the project more scalable by having multiple jsx components files.

**Thoughts**: Since we might be using the same components multiple times in the future, it would be more scalable if we put components into separate files.

### Day 7: January 9, 2017 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started another project using React. This project uses a weather api and React router.

**Thoughts**: Webpack provides a lot of good features such as alias.

**Link(s) to work**: [React Weather](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/React-Weather)



### Day 8: January 10, 2017 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Recently learnt a multimedia framework with a plugin based architecture named GStreamer, and used it to built an audio player. 

**Thoughts**: GStreamer is very extensible because it is plugin-based and components are pipeline, so we can write custom plugins to suit our apps. How GStreamer and ffmpeg differs and helps video and audio streaming can be investigated furthur.

**Link(s) to work**: [Commandline Audio Player](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/Cmdline-AudioPlayer)



### Day 9: January 11, 2017 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on React Weather. 

**Thoughts**: Promises are resolved or rejected. It can be used to replace asynchronous calls that accept callbacks.

**Link(s) to work**: [React Weather](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/React-Weather)



### Day 10: January 12, 2017 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on React Weather. Started implementing API calls in the app.

**Thoughts**: ES6 syntax such as query strings helps concatenate strings to form URLs with parameters, and the axios node package helps make http requests from node.js with promises.

**Link(s) to work**: [React Weather](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/React-Weather)



### Day 11: January 13, 2017 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on React Weather. Spent some time on debugging... and learnt about ES6 arrow functions.

**Thoughts**: It is very easy for React projects to break so in order to debug the app, an useful browser extension is 1. 'React developer tools' by Facebook. Another useful thing to do is to add breakpoints into code using 2. 'debugger;'. One more thing we can do is to add 3. source maps like 'devtool:"cheap-module-eval-source-map"' inside webpack.config.js.

**Link(s) to work**: [React Weather](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/React-Weather)



### Day 12: January 14, 2017 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on React Weather. Started styling the pages using foundation css framework(nav bar, main page position, modals, etc) and jquery.

**Thoughts**: Keep going! Fighting!

**Link(s) to work**: [React Weather](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/React-Weather)



### Day 13: January 15, 2017 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on KWCSSA membership card app backend. We started adding a new feature to the app by allowing users to share their thoughts and even secrets on our app either anonymously or with their usernames.

**Thoughts**: We planned to generate random anonymous names by concatinating random adjectives to nouns, which works well and is easier to implement.

**Link(s) to work**: [KWCSSA Membership Card App - backend](https://github.com/KWCSSA/cssams-backend)



### Day 14: January 16, 2017 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Finished working on React Weather. Finished sending error messages to display in modal. Added custom css and scss features. Finished wiring up the navbar search.

**Thoughts**: [SASS/SCSS](sass-lang.com) is very useful to writing CSS.

**Link(s) to work**: [React Weather](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/React-Weather)



### Day 15: January 17, 2017 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Started working on markdown viewer app.

**Thoughts**: 

**Link(s) to work**: [Markdown Viewer](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/markdown-viewer)



### Day 17: January 19, 2017 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Started working on React timer web app.

**Thoughts**: In order to be more familiar with React and be able to use it when it comes in handy, I decided to make several react apps.

**Link(s) to work**: [React Timer](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/React-Timer)



### Day 18: January 20, 2017 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Started working on a set of solutions to the algorithms questions on CLRS. Finished chapter 2.

**Thoughts**: There is a relationship between inversions and insertion sort that I have not thought about before.

**Link(s) to work**: [CLRS](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/Algorithms)



### Day 19: January 21, 2017 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about Three.js, a JavaScript 3D Library for making WebGL. Planning to use it to model the Earth.

**Thoughts**: The JavaScript community is amazing...

**Link(s) to work**: [Three](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/Three)



### Day 20: January 22, 2017 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on CSSA membership card backend. Added the functionality of generating random chinese names for anonymous users.

**Thoughts**: I used docker's way of generating random names, which is made up using a random adjective followed by a random noun. The outputs are really funny.

**Link(s) to work**: [KWCSSA Membership Card App - backend](https://github.com/KWCSSA/cssams-backend)



### Day 21: January 23, 2017 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Created a repository for practicing algorithms in Java. Started implementing some popular sorting algorithms.

**Thoughts**: The second chapter of CLRS talks about merge sort and insertion sort(extend to a question about inversions). It also shows the proof of why the algorithm works the expected way. This is exactly what I learnt in the course SE212. So it is good to see that the things I learnt can be used in a practical way.

**Link(s) to work**: [Algorithms](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/Algorithms)



### Day 22: January 24, 2017 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Tried implementing a web beacon..

**Thoughts**: Google analytics seem to be providing a way of putting web beacons in code. Did not get it working though, but I will try again next time.

**Link(s) to work**: 



### Day 23: January 25, 2017 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Kept working on some algorithms.

**Thoughts**: Worked on merge sort. There are so many ways to implement merge sort.

**Link(s) to work**: [Algorithms](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/Algorithms)



### Day 24: January 26, 2017 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about JDBC and how to work with postgresql.

**Thoughts**: Remember to close connections!

**Link(s) to work**: 



### Day 25: January 27, 2017 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on allowing email verification for our membership card app.

**Thoughts**: We wanted to implement this feature so that when we put our new "share your secret" module in production, we can restrict users in some way.

**Link(s) to work**: [KWCSSA Membership Card App - backend](https://github.com/KWCSSA/cssams-backend)



### Day 26: January 28, 2017 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Learnt the basics of Hadoop and its ecosystem. Worked on a simple MapReduce job for getting total sales data from purchases report.

**Thoughts**: Parallel computing allows the program to run more efficiently, so in Hadoop HDFS, we break data into 64Mb blocks and store them on different data nodes, and we have multiple mappers and reducers to do work in parallel. Moreover, in order to secure data storage in case of failures(internet, etc), it is necessary to keep multiple copies of the data, like when we have a namenode standby and three copies of the data on different data nodes. Last but not the least, DON'T push big data files to github!

**Link(s) to work**: [Simple MapReduce](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/Learning-Data)



### Day 27: January 29, 2017 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about jython.

**Thoughts**: Jython runs on JVM like Java and I think it is a good choice for writing Hadoop applications.

**Link(s) to work**: [Simple MapReduce](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/Learning-Data)



### Day 28: January 30, 2017 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Implemented a solution for the max sub array problem.

**Thoughts**: This problem is similar to the merge sort problem(using divide and conquer principle) and this solution also has a time complexity of O(nlogn).

**Link(s) to work**: [MaxSubArray](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/Algorithms/tree/master/src/com/isa/DivideAndConquer)



### Day 29: January 31, 2017 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Implemented MapReduce scripts for getting popular links from access log. Learnt the basics about MapReduce design patterns.

**Thoughts**: The design ideas are different from if we want to do the same thing (such as getting the top 10 from the list) in RDBMS.

**Link(s) to work**: [Simple MapReduce](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/Learning-Data)



### Day 30: Feburary 1, 2017 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Implemented MapReduce scripts for classical problems in summarization and structural patterns.

**Thoughts**: There is a pdf uploaded onto Github. It is for MapReduce design patterns. 

**Link(s) to work**: [Simple MapReduce](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/Learning-Data)




### Day 31: Feburary 2, 2017 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Implemented MapReduce scripts for forum data. Analyzed problems such as "for each student what is the hour during which the student has posted the most posts."

**Thoughts**: Interesting stuff...

**Link(s) to work**: [Forum Posts Analysis](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/Forum-Posts-Analysis)




### Day 32: Feburary 3, 2017 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Implemented MapReduce scripts for forum data. Analyzed problems related to correlations and top N.

**Thoughts**: It is better to do calculations only inside reducer rather than mapper. For example, one problem might be we want to find out the mean of the length of answers for every post. We want to calculate the total length inside reducer rather than mapper.

**Link(s) to work**: [Forum Posts Analysis](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/Forum-Posts-Analysis)




### Day 33: Feburary 4, 2017 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Inspired by Phodal's idea of implementing data analysis with pig and elasticsearch, and finally displaying the result on an interactive map using JavaScript AmMap.

**Thoughts**: "JavaScript amMap is a piece of software for creating interactive maps for your web sites and applications. It’s quite different from mapping products like Google Maps." It uses SVG to render maps rather than VML which is too slow for handling large amount of vector data.

**Link(s) to work**: [IP to Geolocation](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/Geo-IP)




### Day 34: Feburary 5, 2017 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: After listening to the first week of lectures of the Coursera Algorithms course, I started working on assignment 1. The program estimates the value of the percolation threshold via Monte Carlo simulation.

**Thoughts**: Used weighted union-find algorithm to achieve the simulation. The worst time complexity is N + M lgN, which can be improved with path compression but still runs ok.

**Link(s) to work**: [Percolation Simulator](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/percolation-simulator)




### Day 35: Feburary 6, 2017 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about different implementations of a stack and their tradeoffs.

**Thoughts**: There are two implementations of stack here, we may want to use them interchangeably based on our needs. If we are concerned about the total cost, we may want to choose resizing array, but if we don't want to have a sudden increase of workload or low guarantee, we may want to choose a linkedlist.

**Link(s) to work**: [Algorithms](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/Algorithms)




### Day 36: Feburary 7, 2017 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about Java generics.

**Thoughts**: A good principle for modular programming is that we should welcome compile-time error and avoid run-time errors. And we also noticed that generic array creation is not allowed in Java. There seems to be various technical debates with this which I should probably read about on the web sometime. How we solved it is to cast Objects into Items. But probably good programs should never casts(the ugly case...).

**Link(s) to work**: [Algorithms](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/Algorithms)




### Day 37: Feburary 8, 2017 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about Java iterators.

**Thoughts**: The client sometimes want to iterate through a data structure but they don't need to know how the data structure is designed or implemented, so that is why we provide them with iterators by implementing the Iterable interface. And then we can use the elegant foreach loop for iteration.

**Link(s) to work**: [Algorithms](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/Algorithms)




### Day 38: Feburary 9, 2017 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed a couple of challenges related to Queues and Stacks.

**Thoughts**: A good question that is raised when working with arrays and Java generics is that why Java prohibits generic array creation(where we can have generic containers like lists, stacks, etc). This is because Java arrays contain, at runtime, information about its component type. So you must know the component type when you create the array. Since you don't know what T is at runtime, you can't create the array. Also seen some answers on [Quora](https://www.quora.com/Why-does-Java-prohibit-generic-array-creation) and [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2927391/whats-the-reason-i-cant-create-generic-array-types-in-java). Moreover, you need to understand that Java arrays are covariant but Java generics are not: that is, 𝚂𝚝𝚛𝚒𝚗𝚐[] is a subtype of 𝙾𝚋𝚓𝚎𝚌𝚝[], but 𝚂𝚝𝚊𝚌𝚔<𝚂𝚝𝚛𝚒𝚗𝚐> is not a subtype of 𝚂𝚝𝚊𝚌𝚔<𝙾𝚋𝚓𝚎𝚌𝚝>.



### Day 39: Feburary 10, 2017 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on randomized queue.

**Thoughts**: There are several ways to implement a randomized queue, for example, I can use an array or a linkedlist structure.

**Link(s) to work**: [Algorithms](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/Algorithms)




### Day 40: Feburary 11, 2017 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Started familiarizing with some sorting algorithms such as insertion sort, etc.

**Thoughts**: In Java, in order to be able to sort any type of objects(int, string, etc), the sort function should call back the object's compareTo() method. 

Callbacks(functions as parameters) are implemented in different languages in different ways. 

In Java, we use interface; in C, we have function pointers; in C++, we have class-type functors; in C#, there are delegates; and in JavaScript, Python, Perl, ML, they are first-class functions.

**Link(s) to work**: [Algorithms](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/Algorithms)




### Day 41: Feburary 12, 2017 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Tried implementing queues and linked lists, and tried doing operations such as merging, sorting, etc.

**Thoughts**: Heapsort takes the advantages of insertion sort(in-place) and merge sort(O(nlgn) time). 

**Link(s) to work**: [Algorithms](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/Algorithms)




### Day 42: Feburary 13, 2017 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about young tableau and quick sort.

**Thoughts**: Young tableau is very similar to how heap sort works, but instead we apply heapify on 2D tableau.

**Link(s) to work**: [Algorithms](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/Algorithms)




### Day 43: Feburary 14, 2017 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Tried optimizing the tail recusion part of quick sort.

**Thoughts**: Quick sort usually performs better than merge sort in practice because it has tail recursion and can be optimized by the compiler. Moreover, since quicksort has two recusion calls, we can optimize furthur by choose the larger partition to do the tail recursion.

**Link(s) to work**: [Algorithms](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/Algorithms)




### Day 44: Feburary 15, 2017 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Took a look at a couple of ways to do sorting in O(n) time including counting sort, radix sort, and bucket sort.

**Thoughts**: These three sorting algos have their own requirements for the input dataset. Counting sort can be used when the input numbers are in a range of 1~k. Radix sort is applied to multiple digit numbers but we can always change the base of the input number(eg. base 10 to 5). And radix sort uses counting sort as a subalgorithm.

**Link(s) to work**: [Algorithms](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/Algorithms)




### Day 45: Feburary 16, 2017 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Added code for counting sort.

**Thoughts**: Same as yesterday:P

**Link(s) to work**: [Algorithms](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/Algorithms)




### Day 46: Feburary 17, 2017 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Finished up on a project at work.

**Thoughts**: Some reflections on the experience is that the performance was a big issue when we are dealing with large incoming data. The program is running at an acceptable speed at the beginning but when I try to optimize the program to display more accurate data, it starts to have long delays. The first time, I changed the frequency of sending data, because I had too many for loops going through arrays and sending data through redis channel where there is actually not much change in the array. Then the second problems was that I created too many redis channels. After fixing these issues, it starts to get back its speed. Then we found that the CPU usage of the redis server is increasing as time goes so I double checked to see if redis connections are closed properly.




### Day 47: Feburary 18, 2017 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Started familiarizing with rooted tree structures.

**Thoughts**: There are some very interesting tree structures such as n-node tree, red-black tree, prefix tree, etc. And we can always traverse the tree recursively or non-recursively.

**Link(s) to work**: [Algorithms](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/Algorithms)




### Day 48: Feburary 19, 2017 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Started familiarizing with how hasing works for hashtables.

**Thoughts**: There is direct mapping tables, which is fast but does not work for large dataset with unlimited number of keys.

**Link(s) to work**: [Algorithms](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/Algorithms)




### Day 49: Feburary 20, 2017 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started familiarizing with trees. More specifically, red-black trees.

**Thoughts**: For red-black tree which are approximately balanced binary search trees with one extra bit of storage per node, color. The root node and every leaf nodes are always black. And a red node always have only black children. And one every simple path from a node, the number of black nodes on the path is the same(black height). In order to deal with boundary conditions, i used a sentinel node to represent null, where every leaf node will point to.

**Link(s) to work**: [Algorithms](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/Algorithms)




### Day 50: Feburary 21, 2017 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Started familiarizing with trees. More specifically, red-black trees.

**Thoughts**: Some helper functions like findMin, findMax, leftRotate, rightRotate, transplant are really helpful in writing code for basic tree operations. 

**Link(s) to work**: [Algorithms](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/Algorithms)



### Day 51: Feburary 22, 2017 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Started familiarizing with trees. More specifically, red-black trees.

**Thoughts**: A red-black tree with n internal nodes(key-bearing nodes, exclude sentinel) has height at most 2lg(n+1). This is based on that the subtree rooted at any node x contains at least 2^bh - 1 internal nodes. Since bh is at least h/2 based on rbt properties, n >= 2^(h/2)-1, thus, lg(n+1) >= h/2.

**Link(s) to work**: [Algorithms](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/Algorithms)



### Day 52: Feburary 23, 2017 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Started familiarizing with trees. More specifically, red-black trees.

**Thoughts**: We can transform any binary search tree into a sorted linkedlist by doing n-1 rotations in total.

**Link(s) to work**: [Algorithms](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/Algorithms)



### Day 53: Feburary 24, 2017 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Started familiarizing with trees. More specifically, red-black trees.

**Thoughts**: To do insertions and deletions of nodes into and from a red-black tree, there are some fixups to do.

**Link(s) to work**: [Algorithms](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/Algorithms)



### Day 54: Feburary 25, 2017 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Get to know about AVL trees.

**Thoughts**: AVL trees vs. Red-Black trees.

**Link(s) to work**: [Algorithms](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/Algorithms)



### Day 55: Feburary 26, 2017 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Get to know some augmented data structures based on red-black trees or binary search trees, such as, interval trees, order statistic trees, etc.

**Thoughts**: Usually, we augmented these common data structures by adding attributes to for example nodes of trees. It is important to keep in mind that we do not change the running complexity of the data structure. For example, trees should still maintain O(lgn) running time for most basic operations.

**Link(s) to work**: [Algorithms](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/Algorithms)



### Day 56: Feburary 27, 2017 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started getting farmiliar with dynamic programming.

**Thoughts**: Finally figured out the difference between top-down and bottom-up approaches...

**Link(s) to work**: [Algorithms](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/Algorithms)



### Day 57: Feburary 28, 2017 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a rod-cutting dp problem.

**Thoughts**: The naive solution basically loops through all possible ways of cutting the rod, and then figure out the optimal solution, which takes exponential time.

**Link(s) to work**: [Algorithms](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/Algorithms)



### Day 58: March 1, 2017 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a rod-cutting dp problem.

**Thoughts**: To improve upon the naive solution, we simply add a memoization table, to achieve a O(n^2) solution because we avoided recalculating overlapping subproblems.

**Link(s) to work**: [Algorithms](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/Algorithms)



### Day 59: March 2, 2017 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Added some test codes for rod-cutting problems.

**Thoughts**: I prefer the bottom up approach of dp problems and plus they usually perform better since they do not have recursion costs. It is easier to understand since we solve all subproblems first so when we come to the bigger problem, we have all it needs to solve this bigger problem using solutions to its smaller subproblems.

**Link(s) to work**: [Algorithms](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/Algorithms)



### Day 60: March 3, 2017 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Started working on a matrix chain parenthesization problem. Same approach as the rod-cutting problem and we are able to improve the running time from O(2^n) to O(n^3). Hooray

**Thoughts**: I did not notice before that if we have a chain of matrices, how we parenthesize them can make a huge difference in the running time of their chain multiplication.

**Link(s) to work**: [Algorithms](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/Algorithms)



### Day 61: March 4, 2017 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Used several techniques to solve the classic fibonacci problem.

**Thoughts**: Math and statistics are indeed really important subjects, especially when I am analyzing algorithms' recurrence...

**Link(s) to work**: [Algorithms](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/Algorithms)



### Day 62: March 5, 2017 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Continued to work on some dynamic programming problems. Started looking at some properties of the problem that imply that we should use dynamic programming techniques.

**Thoughts**: The two ingradients of a dp problems are 1) optimal subproblems which may lead to a bottom up solution, 2) overlapping subproblems which may lead to a recursive top down solution with memoization.

**Link(s) to work**: [Algorithms](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/Algorithms)



### Day 63: March 6, 2017 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Continued to work on some dynamic programming problems. 

**Thoughts**: Noticed that merge sort problem cannot be improved by memoization because it does not have overlapping subproblems, despite that it is a nice divide-and-conquer problem.

**Link(s) to work**: [Algorithms DP](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/Algorithms/tree/master/src/com/isa/DynamicProgramming)



### Day 64: March 7, 2017 Tuesday

### Day 66: March 9, 2017 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Played around with some linux cron tasks.

**Thoughts**: Crontab allows me to schedule a task in specific syntax that cron understands without explicitly setting up a timer to keep track so this is very convinient.

**Link(s) to work**: [Algorithms DP](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/Algorithms/tree/master/src/com/isa/DynamicProgramming)



### Day 67: March 10, 2017 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Practice some old problems for google i/o 2016 to prepare for tomorrow's code jam.

**Thoughts**: One problem involves some math which I probably will learn about next term so I am looking forward to learning that:)

**Link(s) to work**: [Google I/O Code Jam 2016](https://github.com/Yiyun-Liang/Google-IO-CodeJam/tree/master/src/com/isa/GoogleIO2016)



### Day 68: March 11, 2017 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Participated in the Google I/O Code Jam for Women 2017.

**Thoughts**: There are quite a few interesting problems and since we need to submit a solution for a small input and a big input. Most of the time, a brute force solution will suffice for the small input. When it comes to the bigger input, we sometimes need to find the pattern in the problem, to see if there is a way to solve the problem without checking all the possibilities. And this can be achieved by doing some math. Math is so important.

### Day 69: March 12, 2017 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Continued to work on some dynamic programming problems. 

**Thoughts**: Started looking at the optimal binary search tree problem. Noticed that 2D arrays are frequently used to construct solution and memo table for dp problems. Moreover, we often pick a chain length to divide the problem into ones with different length.

### Day 72: March 15, 2017 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Started taking the machine learning course by Andrew Ng on Coursera.

**Thoughts**: Machine learning is actually teaching machines to learn. That is not what I thought it was before so it is pretty good to know that.

### Day 73: March 16, 2017 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Kept learning about machine learning concepts.

**Thoughts**: Math is so important. I never felt like that until I started learning about algorithms and advanced computer science topics.

### Day 75: March 18, 2017 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Started farmilarizing with Greedy Algorithms.

**Thoughts**: I used to think that greedy algorithms are just not worth the time to learn about because they do not always work. After digging a bit deeper into these algorithms, I realized that they are smart and they do save you time and space, but you have to also be good at math in order to think of greedy approaches sometimes...

### Day 76: March 19, 2017 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about java.util.stream class introduced in Java 8.

**Thoughts**: This truly makes java more functional. When I was learning Scala, I thought that it would be great if these simple operations(eg. collect, reduce, flatmap, map, Optional, etc) can be done in java. So it is great to see that we can now be functional in java as well.

### Day 78: March 21, 2017 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Thought about some programming tips and put them into random notes.

**Thoughts**: Listened to a live stream the other day on how to prepare for job interviews. There are always times where I need a dynamic array, and I start thinking about using arraylists. But now I have realized that stacks can be good choices as well.

### Day 79: March 22, 2017 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about B-Tree.

**Thoughts**: I have been seeing 2-3-4 trees and b+ trees a lot recently so it is good that I finally understand what they are. I did not know that b-tree is good for minimizing disk accesses, which saves efficiency and cost.

### Day 80: March 23, 2017 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Kept working on B-Trees.

**Thoughts**: Traversing a b-tree is easy once i understand how traversing works for normal binary trees, but for b-trees, it takes O(klgn) times now where k is the number of keys stored in a node, and log is based on k rather than 2 as well.

### Day 82: March 25, 2017 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Started working on graphs.

**Thoughts**: Even though I learnt some about graph theories during ECE 103, I still feel intimidated by graphs. I guess it is important to understand BFS and DFS and several other algorithms.

### Day 84: March 27, 2017 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Finally had some progress on my vr app...

**Thoughts**: OpenGL is so HARD to USEEEEE!!! WHY do we use pitch, yaw, and row rather than x!, y!, and z! What is a quaternion!!! Why do we have so many ways to describe a 3D space!!!

### Day 89: April 1, 2017 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Graphs are closely related to trees.

**Thoughts**: Trees are actually a type of graph so I am trying to convince myself that graphs are not that terrible...

### Day 90: April 2, 2017 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Object-oriented designs.

**Thoughts**: When I think about oo design questions, I am not able to think of details almost all the time, so there are so many things I can add to my design which will make the system more robust and extendable. But I do think these types of questions are super important since I often get work that needs these types of skills from my supervisor...

### Day 91: April 3, 2017 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about some C++ syntaxs that are related to object-oriented programming in C/C++.

**Thoughts**: Although I took a course in first year that uses C++, I do not feel that I have a solid understanding of the language. Moreover, I am spending a lot of time on Java. I have a strong feeling that I do not have enough time to do what I want to do and to learn what I want to learn!!!

**Thoughts**: It is very interesting that all google products can be used together, eg. google cloud dataflow, google cloud storage, datastores, etc... 

**Link(s)**: [Google Cloud Dataflow Official Website](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/)

### Day 94: April 6, 2017 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I was writing my work term report this week. I decided to write about Google BigQuery and other real-time data processing solutions.

**Thoughts**: In one of Google's white papers, they mentioned that BQ uses two core technologies to achieve the fast execution time of big data processing, one is columnar storage which allows faster scan on the table for queries that only accesses one attribute, the other one is tree architecture that allows better work distribution. 

**Link(s)**: [Google BigQuery White Paper](https://cloud.google.com/files/BigQueryTechnicalWP.pdf)

### Day 96: April 8, 2017 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Spent some time trying to figure out a good way to draw a path that follows the real world's transportation system between two geographical points(described by latitude and longitude).

**Thoughts**: Started with dijkastra's algorithm but the right path is not always the shortest one...

### Day 99: April 11, 2017 Tuesday
### Day 100: April 12, 2017 Wednesday

##### 100 days of code is a great activity but I did not fully meet the requirement this time. I was quite busy during the time period and I spent most of my time on algorithms instead of individual projects because I got a strong sense of its importance during my internship. 

##### The one requirement that I met is that I coded every single day for at least one hour (not including the time I spent on my internship). So this log served as a daily log/dairy where I put down my thoughts and feelings. It still looks good when I look back to the progress I have made here and there during the 100 days. It also gives me more confidence to face more challenging work in the future. I will definitely join this activity again in the future.
##### I cannot believe 100 days have passed...
